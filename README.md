## Sales Data Analysis and Dashboard

### Overview

This project involves analyzing sales data using Python and creating an interactive dashboard in Google Colab. The analysis includes basic statistics, data visualizations, predictive modeling using Random Forest Regressor, and sales forecasting.

### Features

#### Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:

Converted sale_date to DateTime format.

Extracted year_month for time-based analysis.

#### Descriptive Statistics:

Provided insights into sales trends, quantity sold, and price distribution.

#### Data Visualization:

Created interactive charts using Plotly.

A bar chart for monthly sales trends of a selected product.

A line chart showing total sales over time.

#### Predictive Analysis:

Implemented a Random Forest Regressor for sales forecasting.

Evaluated model performance using Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Squared Error (MSE).

#### Sales Forecasting:

Predicted future sales for the next 6 months based on historical data.

### Installation & Setup

To run the project, follow these steps:

### Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-repo-name.git

Open the project in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook.

### Install dependencies (if not already installed):

pip install pandas numpy plotly scikit-learn

Load the dataset and run the notebook cells sequentially.

### Files in the Repository

sales_analysis.ipynb - Jupyter Notebook containing the full analysis and dashboard.

sales_data.csv - Sample sales dataset (if provided).

README.md - Documentation of the project.

### Usage Instructions

Open the Jupyter Notebook in Google Colab.

Run each cell to load the data, perform analysis, and generate the interactive dashboard.

Modify the selected_product variable to view sales trends for different products.

Interpret the sales forecast results to plan future business strategies.

### Insights from the Analysis

Sales fluctuate over different months, with some periods showing higher demand.

Total revenue has seen a decline in recent months, possibly due to external factors such as competition or seasonality.

The predictive model forecasts a steady number of units sold for the next six months, which can guide inventory management.

### Conclusion

This project provides an end-to-end sales analysis solution, helping businesses understand sales patterns and predict future demand. The interactive dashboard enhances data-driven decision-making.
